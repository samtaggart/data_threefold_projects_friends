# Green Edge Cloud

## Mission & Vision
In *Green Edge Cloud*  we are facing a tsunami of compute and storage capacity demand. The current internet giants are already struggling to meet this demand, and will continue to push their highly centralised technologies that compromise personal sovereignty and privacy, while burning through an unsustainable amount of energy and natural resources. Not only does this represent an excellent business opportunity for a truly decentralised compute & storage platform, but also an opportunity to have a positive impact on the planet and the future of the human race.  

``` Green Edge Cloud is farming ThreeFold grid capacity for Enterprises in world class datacenters.```

## Benefits our planet
Green Edge Cloud believes in helping create a world where technology promotes and protects personal liberty and sovereignty. A decentralised internet is inherently faster, greener, more private, and more secure.


## Threefold Farmer
Green Edge Cloud is a ThreeFold farmer and actively back the foundation as it's mission, And creating TF Grid capacity and actively seeking uses cases for the TF Grid.


### Roadmap

- Generic explanation: what is there today, what is coming up?
Answer: Green Edge Cloud has a total capacity of 20 petabytes of storage and just short of 3000 cores in data centers located in:
Cape Town
Frankfurt
Rochester
Salzburg
St Gallen
Toronto
Vienna

More capacity in future datacenters coming up in:
Amsterdam
Berlin
Graz
Innsbruck

- How does your project intend to measure impact?
Answer: Impact is measured by making Enterprise grade IT capacity available at lower commercial rates and for the future GEC would like to report on the kWhrs saved in producing this capacity.
