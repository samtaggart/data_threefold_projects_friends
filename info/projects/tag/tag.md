# TAG2TAG

## Mission & Vision
 TAG2TAG aims to develop a platform for peer-to-peer education, where teacher becomes student and student becomes teacher. In the first stage, we will target refugees and teachers globally, and in the second stage we will focus on global projects like climate, poverty, and more.

## Benefits our planet
 We have for years been working to bring positive and needed changes to the education system and this is another step forward. A peer-to-peer education system opens up the possibilities for learning and positive solutions for our world.

## Supported by Threefold
 The platform will be run on the ThreeFold Grid and will utilize elements of 3Bot technology.

 The P2P Zoom (tentatively named 3Bot Meet) solution will be used to allow teachers to teach refugees. (We have already been doing this for five years: projectkakuma.com.) This approach can be scaled to "everyone" teaches "everyone." For example, 1 teacher teaches 1 teacher, 1 teacher teaches a classroom in another country, 1 student teaches 1 teacher, 1 student teaches several other students. The tool can be used for webinars from experts as well. We will likely use other elements of 3Bot, including file storage.


### Roadmap
 We have a community of thousands of teachers globally which allows to connect to children and teachers in refugee camps. Our platform allows to connect, create and share. This way we can - Train teachers in refugee camps (important as 67% did not complete secondary education), Have interactions between refugee students and students globally changing their mindset and fighting polarization, Teach refugee students, Teach young adults to code so they can find a job.

## Next step: 
Thanks to TF technology (e.g. 3Bot Meet) : 

  We will be able to allow people globally to connect and learn from peers globally including refugees and people living in harsh conditions. 

  We will be able to set up global projects to tackle climate change and other issues allowing students to connect, brainstorm, create, share, solve problems and take action. 

## Measured impact
 We will measure impact in multiple ways – number of teachers and students brought on to the platform, number / impact of solutions brought for global projects, and more. We will work with universities of Harvard, Brussels and Nairobi to collect qualitative and quantitative data measuring impact.
