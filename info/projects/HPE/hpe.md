# Green Edge
We are facing a tsunami of compute and storage capacity demand. The current internet giants are already struggling to meet this demand, and will continue to push their highly centralised technologies that compromise personal sovereignty and privacy, while burning through an unsustainable amount of energy and natural resources. Not only does this represent an excellent business opportunity for a truly decentralised compute & storage platform, but also an opportunity to have a positive impact on the planet and the future of the human race.
## Impact

## Powered by ThreeFold
Green Edge is a threefold farmers that underwrites all of the ThreeFold foundation technology and values.  It has large quantities of 3nodes in datacenters and will be expading into much more.  

It's also is creating end users (startups and sme's) service to increase consumption and usage of their farms.

## Join saving our planet!
We believe in helping create a world where technology promotes and protects personal liberty and sovereignty. A decentralized internet is inherently faster, greener, more private, and more secure.
