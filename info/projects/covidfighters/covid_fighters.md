# Covidfighters

## About

Covid Fighters have built a technology consortium to test Covid19 from a mobile unit to test whether or not a test subject is infected and contagious. The actual test takes only a few hours and the mobile unit can be deployed in a matter of days.
Various types of people (that need to be tested) can be tested easily and frequently and have their contamination state verified and stored in a way that is easily auditable. The process is end-to-end and involves remote medical specialists to assist and advise. Covidfighters are putting this consortium together to make the world a safer place for people and economies to maintain their 'normal’.

## Mission

To bring the highest standards of safety during Covid 19 while empowering people to maintain their ‘normal lives’ during such situations.

## Impact

By bringing the necessary solutions for mass testing and auditing, Covid Fighters can prevent the further spread of viruses such as Covid 19 while enabling individuals, businesses and economies to maintain their 'usual' ongoing activities. Considering how Covid Impacted our world, such solutions are of upmost importance to protect our poeple and economies.

description = "People are social individuals and need contact with each other. On the other hand, pandemic situations like now with corona are very dangerous especially to the weakest and older people. We need to help in both ways - re-gaining social life and staying healthy. Threefold could be a great partner for the identification of individuals and secure transmission of data. It is one of very few serious alternatives that are not owned by states or governments.Both data security and storage capabilities provided by ThreeFold will be used. We will provide people with individual 3bots, so they would be identified before getting their attests."
