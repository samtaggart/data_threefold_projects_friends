# Generation Blue

We enable the shift to an Earth Positive economy based on reciprocity, where every act of consumption is met with an opposite act of regeneration and protection of nature. Our blockchain based ecosystems accounting system enables anyone to get Earth Positive by investing in environmental impact tokens.

## Impact

We protect biodiversity by empowering communities with exponential technologies such as blockchain, focusing on the most threatened ecosystems such as tropical forests and mangroves.

## Mission

Empower every global citizen to protect and regenerate nature

## Powered by ThreeFold

We are proud to partner with ThreeFold to securely host our decentralized mobile apps.

## Join saving our planet!

Join the 10X Climate Positive challenge. Let’s take responsibility of our carbon footprint, and get a handprint that’s 10 times bigger!
