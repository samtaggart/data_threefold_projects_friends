# Gravity Group

*Gravity Group* specialise in supporting evolutionary entrepreneurs and innovators of transformative technologies that benefit all life and restore the balance of nature through conscious applications for the greater good.

## Impact

Gravity Group’s team has previously generated over $20B in revenue for companies we have led or owned, and historically returned over $3B to shareholders. Our team members have stewarded over 50 companies to exit and built over 100 technology platforms. 

## Partnership with ThreeFold

Gravity Group can support ThreeFold in three main areas:
1) Token design, launch and marketing, 
2) Business Development & Partnerships within the Gravity portfolio of 22 mission-driven companies and beyond and 
3) Fundraising planning and management. 
Gravity will onboard our portfolio of tech companies as early adopters, promote growth and user feedback. For instance we founded several award winning enterprise collaboration VR/AR/Immersive platforms that are high storage and bandwidth use cases. Gravity also has several partnerships with advanced and mission aligned technologies launching digital transformation projects in emerging markets which would make a perfect fit for a new internet and personal data ownership in areas such as smart cities/countries, micro lending, ESG Security Token Offering/exchange platforms, spatial web, advanced medical technologies and decentralized social media to name a few.

## Mission

Gravity Group focuses on purpose based companies to increase their positive impact, prosperity and legacy for the betterment of humanity and our Planet.

## Join saving our planet!

Next up is the first close of our fund Gravity Select Ventures to provide equity and debt investments to our growing portfolio.
