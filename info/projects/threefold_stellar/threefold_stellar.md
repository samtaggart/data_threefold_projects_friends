# ThreeFold on Stellar

ThreeFold is actively using Stellar Network as a payment layer for its ThreeFold Token. 3Bot, the digital avatar living on ThreeFold Grid will be directly integrated with Stellar Decentralized Exchange to give it's owner access to the immediate liquidity for all kind of digital assets.

## Impact

The main impact of the collaboration will be realized in increased rate of adoption of opensource and easy to use technologies that boost economic empowerment for developers community, for enterprises and small businesses, and at last but not least - for regular people. ThreeFold and Stellar foundations have very aligned goals - to create equitable access to the internet capacity and global financial system. Both organizations based their foundation on open-source technology and aims to unlock world's economic potential and, most importantly, to empover people in developing countries and all around the globe. By creating equal opportunties for people around the globe and by financial and technology inclusion for developing countries we can uplift general conditions of humanity and our planet.

## Partnership with ThreeFold

Number of the Stellar Network nodes will be deployed on ThreeFold Grid in autonomous environment to ensure secure and truly decentralized expansion of the Stellar Network. Stellar and ThreeFold will promote their cooperation for the blockchain community to inspire development of new projects and attract new users to the ecosystem. As of today ThreeFold is using Stellar Network as transactional layer for its ThreeFold Token. Stellar Nodes are deployed on ThreeFold Grid. Future steps are - Integrate Stellar Decentralized Exchange inside of 3Bot, launch a marketing collaboration.
