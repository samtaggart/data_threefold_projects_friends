# TF Grid & Network Promotion


### Roadmap

Generic explanation: what is there today, what is coming up?
We are currently talking with more than 25 blockchain projects out of top 200 to invite them to explore possible use cases on the ThreeFold Grid. Five of them already agreed/signed for a co-promotion marketing campaign with us and will invite their community to try out the ThreeFold Grid. 

How does your project intend to measure impact?
The success of our efforts can be measured by the growth of the ThreeFold Grid in terms of number of hardware nodes, the amount of capacity utilized on the ThreeFold Grid and the number of projects for example from the blockchain space using and promoting the ThreeFold Grid.

mission = "Our mission is to enable +1 billion people with access to the fundamental internet infrastructure and their full digital lives (education, banking and internet access) for less then 1$ per person per month by 2030."

description = "Our project is about promoting the adoption and expansion of ThreeFold P2P Cloud in order to empower a new and democratized digital economy based on our values of equality of access, data sovereignty and environmental sustainability.

ThreeFold's Grid will help to give data sovereignty back to people and countries, as well as enable accessibility to digital innovation to billions of people in countries lacking in internet infrastructure and finally it will help dramatically reduce the footprint of our current internet by using smaller and more efficient mini data nodes.

The ThreeFold Grid is one of the most essential layers in the ThreeFold Project as it provides a global mesh network to run and store our internet applications and services."
