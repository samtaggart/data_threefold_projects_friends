# DigiByte

*DigiByte* is a rapidly growing open-source blockchain created in late 2013 and released in early 2014. After 6 years of forward-thinking development, DigiByte has become one of the safest, fastest, longest and most decentralized UTXO blockchain in existence.

## Impact

Thousands of volunteers from all over the world have contributed to DigiByte in countless ways for years to make it what it is today. It is a truly grassroots movement to protect and promote the true principles of decentralization and empower DigiByte and its community to establish and maintain a sustainable decentralized world. Planet first!

## Powered by ThreeFold

The DigiByte network runs on a mix of servers managed by DigiByte volunteers and virtual machines or containers in commercial cloud provider environments.  This is decentralized to a degree but can be more decentralized if the DigiByte blockchain nodes can run on ThreeFold Grid nodes truly decentralized, energy-efficient and everywhere. 

## Join saving our planet!
The efficient operation of the 3nodes help the DigiByte software to useless underlying capacoty for processing and fat networking enhances time to reach consensus.
