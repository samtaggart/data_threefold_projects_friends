# DigiByte Foundation

DigiByte Foundation’s vision is to empower the community to decentralize the world. That means we want to facilitate and support all of DigiByte’s community to be a pilot for the blockchain community at large. The core values the DigiByte Foundation - and anyone who supports it - subscribes to are: decentralization, inclusiveness, permissionless, integrity, transparency – openness, consensus, thought leadership.
The goal of the DigiByte Foundation is to promote and support the DigiByte Blockchain and its users, to stimulate the development and worldwide adoption of the DigiByte blockchain and the principles of decentralization in general. Development of DGB technology is a core focus point. In our opinion this is essential to further establish and maintain a sustainable decentralized world. We arrive at this from an underlying and unwavering belief that decentralization is unstoppable.

## Impact

Thousands of volunteers from all over the world have contributed to DigiByte in countless ways for years to make it what it is today. It is a truly grassroots movement to protect and promote the true principles of decentralization and empower DigiByte and its community to establish and maintain a sustainable decentralized world. Planet first!
Once the foundation has garnered some funds, the foundation will in conjunction with the DigiByte community, not only initiate and promote projects and community initiatives, but also promote the DigiByte ecosystem and further development by supporting the developers, business developers and marketers, with a focus on outreach, awareness, education, adoption.

## Powered by ThreeFold

The DigiByte network runs on a mix of servers managed by DigiByte volunteers and virtual machines or containers in commercial cloud provider environments.  This is decentralized to a degree but can be more decentralized if the DigiByte blockchain nodes can run on ThreeFold Grid nodes truly decentralized, energy-efficient and everywhere. 

## Join saving our planet!

The efficient operation of the 3nodes helps the DigiByte software to use less underlying capacity for processing and that networking enhances time to reach consensus.
