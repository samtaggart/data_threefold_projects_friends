# Solidaridad

The current economic model is failing. It’s an economy of, by, and for the top 1 %. Today, only a few billionaires own as much as half of the planet’s population. For billions of people the promise of globalization did not deliver. A new disruptive economic process that seeks to establish an economy of, by, and for the people is taking shape. It has the potential to become a movement. We call it a solidarity economy, a countermodel to the extractive economy that extracts wealth from the earth, workers and communities without fair payment or regard for the problems that ensue. In partnership with Threefold, Solidaridad seeks to develop concrete alternatives to five global oligopolies from whom we need to reclaim sustainability.

## Impact

Whilst watching mirroring portraits of Rembrandt at the Thyssen Museum in Madrid, Weynand Kuijpers and I were discussing the emergence of a new, solidarity economy movement. It was Wednesday 26 February, the day that later turned out to be the start of the now called Great Lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A solidarity economy, we agreed, would follow eight core principles. 
- Community: the common good comes first. 
- Community creates the conditions that allow each of us to flourish, the earth being the ultimate healthy human community. 
- Inclusion: Creating opportunity for those long excluded
- Place: We care about where we belong, where we live, where we have our land, family and jobs. We need to build community wealth that stays local. In contrast, the extractive economy moves wealth across the globe, away from where it matters. 
- Good work: Putting labour before capital, so that work pays a living wage; 
- Democratic ownership: In a solidarity economy, enterprises are human communities, where decision making involves moral agents.
- Sustainability: Protecting the ecosystem as the foundation of life, so that it may remain productive and healthy forever. Health: we care about the individual health through access to healthy food, community health through protection of the health status of the community, and by creating a herd community against new contagious diseases.  
- Ethical finance: Social and ecological benefit is the aim.

How strange it might sound, we realized that a solidarity economy is totally possible.

What is the core Problem? The current economic paradigm favors the uncontrolled extraction of value from the planet and people, supported by underlying international policies. As a result, our ecosystems are collapsing, accelerated by climate change. For 1,6 billion small-scale farmers and their families, 1,2 billion workers in vulnerable employment, and at least 1 billion workers in the informal economy, their everyday hard work is not rewarding. This is in stark contrast to only 26 billionaires who are key players in further pushing the five oligopolies from whom Threefold & Solidaridad needs to reclaim sustainability: food, pharmacy, energy, big data, and currency. They are the power towers that dictate the strategic direction of our global economy, and have tremendous impact on the daily well-being of our beneficiaries. 

What is the core Question? Can we initiate a new global movement around the solidarity economy with committed leadership and through the use of creative solutions, leading to inspiring transformative practices, also in lower- and middle income countries?

What is the core Answer? In an agile partnership with selected individuals, stakeholders, and donors, Threefold & Solidaridad and partners will jointly develop a new and long-lasting leadership program to build further on the emerging global movement around the solidarity economy. Specific focus will be on answering the 5 oligopolies with distinctive counter-models: healthy food, traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), renewable energy, Fairdata, and tokenization based on ethical finance. 

## Partnership with ThreeFold

Value proposition: Threefold, Solidaridad and other partners intend to build and interlink a think tank, a product lab, and three landscapes of change. Aim is to engage leadership at the think tank, incubate their ideas into ready-to-use products developed in ‘The Lab’, and accelerate the emerging solidarity economy movement by testing these products in real live ‘landscapes of change’ around three rural-urban nexuses in megacities and their rural peripheries. South America, Africa and Asia. Ultimately this work must filter and demonstrate scalable and transformative approaches that can be forerunners to a new economic order.

## Join saving our planet!

Three levels of intervention
1. Think tank: Think tanks have been instrumental in creating the present, extractive economic order. Likewise, the globalization of capital has been strongly advocated by powerful think tanks. Think tanks have been effective in advocating policy change. The model is also a good fit for Threefold & Solidaridad, considering its long history of advocacy and thought leadership. We know how to amplify and connect ‘Voices from the South’ and to empower a global movement. Through our global network, we believe we can effectively influence policies and pilot new economic models.

2. The Lab: Product development on healthy food, TEK, renewable energy, Fairdata, tokenization. Tapping from state of art IT, dedicated investments, knowledge, skill sets, and training modules, with the aim to develop and bring to market tailored, ready-to-implement tooling.

3. Landscapes of change: building democratic food-water-energy systems on the rural-urban nexus in - potentially - Place: Buenos Aires/São Paulo, Johannesburg and Kolkata. Megacities with large peri-urban supplies on food, energy, pharmacy, big data, currency. Form: not-for-profit, and public-private partnerships.

description = "Solidaridad works to create sustainable supply chains from  producers to consumers for commodities. Examples of commodities involved are cotton, livestock, tea, coffee, fruit and vegetables, cocoa, palmoil etc. Today commodity producers retain the least margin where the final retailer usually makes the most in the supply chain.  Solidaridad disagrees with this setup and actively promotes wealth creation at the start of supply chains.  This is where the farmers spend time, effort, care and love for the product they produces.  Solidaridad considers this fair sourcing."
