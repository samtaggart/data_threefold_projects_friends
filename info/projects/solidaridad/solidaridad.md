    AQUACULTURE: Sourcing sustainable fish and shrimp from the seas

    DAIRY: Change from within the dairy market can improve the livelihoods

## Fair data 
 is all about making the farmers (producers) own their created and shared data for a fair prices.  Why should data from hardwaokring farmers end up in the hands of a small number of food giants and be used to create more wealth for those giants.  The wealth creation needs to take place at the foundation of the food production supply chain, not the top.


## Benefits our planet
 More sustainable production of food and wealth creation for farmers leads to less poverty and hunger amongst those farmers.

## Supported by Threefold
 Linking data ownership to individuals in developing parts of the worlds brings unique challenges to manage, maintain and monetise this data (by farmers themselves).  The ThreeFold peer2peer cloud and unique 3bot digital avatar bring capabilities to these communities that have not been available to them before.

 3bot will safeguard the farmers data and allows for data analysis / mining activities to be done in a sustainable and effecting manner where the farmers remains owner of the data and has a means for creating additional (digital) income.



### Roadmap

 High level desing of the requried archietcture is done, feasability study planned. Funding has been identifies and donor and sponsor organisations.

## Measured impact
 The number of farmers using the Solidaridad applications to record and generate data will be connected to individual 3bots storing and managing information. Key statistics can be generated from number of farmers represented, generated digtial income for datasharing, amont of data collected and kept for the farmers, and many more.
