# True Carbon

*True Carbon* is reversing the climate crisis by effectively enhancing natural processes of soil sequestration. Agriculture is capable of absorbing carbon into the soil where it fulfills a range of valuable ecosystem services, including CO absorption and storage, and increased fertility.

## Impact

Even if we stopped emitting today, we would still have to remove an excess of roughly 500 Gt of CO2 from the atmosphere to return to pre-climate crisis levels. Without further emissions, the carbon in the air is already capable of causing severe global impacts. Nature has its ways of healing and regenerating and we are focusing on enhancing these natural processes to help heal our planet reversing the damage the industrial and agriculture industry has caused by incentivizing organic farming, collecting and providing data of soil condition including its ability to absorb and store CO as well as increase of CO storing capabilities by soil sequestration.

## Powered by threefold

Thanks to ThreeFold technology we plan to set up digital monitoring, automated data collection and sample analysis on farmlands across the globe allowing us to work also with local farmers in remote areas.

## Mission

Solving climate crisis by effectively enhancing the natural process of soil sequestration

 ## Join saving our planet!
 
Global issues can't be solved in one day. It is a process we start today that will make the difference tomorrow. Join us in reversing climate change!
