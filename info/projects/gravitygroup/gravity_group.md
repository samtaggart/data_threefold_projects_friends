# Gravity Group

*Gravity Group* focuses on technologies and business models that deliver measurable outcomes to improve both Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We have three entities - Gravity Accelerator - Gravity Accelerator provides growth and investability services to purpose-driven companies entering their next critical phase of growth. Our unique discovery, due diligence, and acceleration programs are designed to generate the highest impact multiples and probability of success for our companies. We also design great cultures - the secret weapon of successful companies. Gravity Investment Partners - Gravity Investment Partners (GIP) is a venture fund focused on mission-driven teams working on high-growth projects that leverage “inevitable technologies” to enable their solutions. GIP looks for differentiated investment opportunities with strong unit economics and sustainable business models. Gravity Capital - Gravity Capital is a capital formation engine that provides investor relations and roadshow services for our top-performing portfolio companies. Our Capital group helps provide the fuel to accelerate initiatives and bring innovative ideas to life.

## Impact

Gravity Group’s team has previously generated over $20B in revenue for companies we have led or owned, and historically returned over $3B to shareholders. Our team members have stewarded over 50 companies to exit and built over 100 technology platforms. 

## Partnership with ThreeFold

Gravity Group can support ThreeFold in three main areas - Token design, launch and marketing, Business Development & Partnerships within the Gravity portfolio of 22 mission-driven companies and beyond and fundraising planning and management. Gravity will onboard our portfolio of tech companies as early adopters, promote growth and user feedback. For instance we founded several award winning enterprise collaboration VR/AR/Immersive platforms that are high storage and bandwidth use cases.Gravity also has several partnerships with advanced and mission aligned technologies launching digital transformation projects in emerging markets which would make a perfect fit for a new internet and personal data ownership in areas such as smart cities/countries, micro lending, ESG Security Token Offering/exchange platforms, spatial web, advanced medical technologies and decentralized social media to name a few.
