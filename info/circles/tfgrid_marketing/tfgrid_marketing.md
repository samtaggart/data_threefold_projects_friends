# ThreeFold Marketing (TF Grid Marketing)

*ThreeFold Grid* is an infrastructure empowering a new and democratized digital economy based on our values of equality of access, data sovereignty and environmental sustainability. We aim to enable +1 billion people with access to the fundamental internet infrastructure and their full digital lives (education, banking and internet access) for less then 1$ per person per month by 2030.

## Impact

ThreeFold's Grid will help to give data sovereignty back to people and countries, as well as enable accessibility to digital innovation to billions of people in countries lacking in internet infrastructure and finally it will help dramatically reduce the footprint of our current internet by using smaller and more efficient mini data nodes. The success of our efforts can be measured by the growth of the ThreeFold Grid in terms of number of hardware nodes, the amount of capacity utilized on the ThreeFold Grid and the number of projects for example from the blockchain space using and promoting the ThreeFold Grid. We are currently talking with more than 25 blockchain projects out of top 200 to invite them to explore possible use cases on the ThreeFold Grid. Five of them already agreed/signed for a co-promotion marketing campaign with us and will invite their community to try out the ThreeFold Grid.

## Support this project

ThreeFold Marketing supports the TF Grid expansion and is funded by ThreeFoldâ€™s [Token Distribution Event (TDE)](https://wiki.threefold.io/#/tdeoverview)</a> for the impact it brings to our planet and humanity.
The ThreeFold Token (TFT) represents a unit of capacity on the new Internet and is created only when new capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid. Each project on the TDE benefits from fund allocations in the form of branded TFTs. 
You can buy specially branded TFTs to directly support the TF Foundation, and the growth of a new conscious internet.
