# Green Edge

*Green Edge* is the first certified & largest ThreeFold farmer. To demonstrate the incredible potential of the ThreeFold grid, *Green Edge* is providing an Infrastructure-as-a-Service platform for businesses looking for greener, more cost effective solutions than AWS, Azure and Google Cloud.

## Impact

We are facing a tsunami of compute and storage capacity demand. The current internet giants are already struggling to meet this demand, and will continue to push their highly centralised technologies that compromise personal sovereignty and privacy, while burning through an unsustainable amount of energy and natural resources. Not only does this represent an excellent business opportunity for a truly decentralised compute & storage platform, but also an opportunity to have a positive impact on the planet and the future of the human race.

## Mission

Green Edge is helping ThreeFold to create a decentralised internet that is inherently faster, greener, more private, and more secure than today's internet.

## Partnership with ThreeFold

We fully support the ThreeFold foundation, and its goals. We hope that our certified capacity will help ThreeFold achieve their mission of a green, decentralised internet that puts personal sovereignty and freedom first.

## Join saving our planet!
