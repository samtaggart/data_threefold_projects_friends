# Covidfighters

Covidfighters are looking to build a technology consortium to test for covid19 in a mobile unit and test whether or not a test subject is infected and contagious. The actual test takes only a few hours and the mobile unit can be deployed in a matter of days.  
Various types of workers and people (that need to be tested) can be tested easily and frequently and have their contamination state verified and stored in a way that other people can audit this.  The process is end to end and involves remote doctors to make the final call. Covidfighters is putting this consortium together to make the world a little bit more normal. 

## Impact

Health care and social workers can continue to do what they do and businesses, families and individuals can have social and business meetings and be sure of the non-risk coming with that.

## Mission

We want to help the people of the world to get back to somehow normal life beside keeping the highest standards of safety regarding covid virus.

## Powered by ThreeFold

ThreeFold is playing a role to provide the infrastructure on which the required IT applications will run. ThreeFold also potentially will provide 3bot technology to store the test subjects data in a private and secure storage for what the test subject decides with whom to share his/her test stauts with.

## Join saving our planet!

Providing a safe environment for people to work and socialize and to make the world a better place.
