# Artheon

*The Artheon VR Museum* is and always will be a free educational platform offering immersive, next level interaction with objects of cultural heritage. Our vision is to provide one stop full spectrum art education platform to access, learn and share knowledge in art and culture from across the globe.

## Impact

Art is one of the most important tools to inspire faith and cultural growth giving a new perspective of looking at reality. We believe that free global access to fine art and culture is a prerequisite for the development of human kind.

## Powered by threefold

The Artheon is supported by the ThreeFold Foundation and is hosted on ThreeFold Grid. Hosting on ThreeFold Grid allows us to share free global access to history, art and culture across geographical and cultural borders in true decentralized manner.

## Mission

At Artheon we believe that free global access to fine art and culture is a prerequisite for the development of human kind and for that we are building VR Museum that is and always will be a free educational platform.

 ## Join saving our planet!
 
Artheon VR Museum is growing into a crowdsourced global art database empowering smaller museums, private collections, galleries and individuals with tools to publish and display artwork and provide courses, tours, lectures, events, around art culture and history.

## Support this project

Artheon is funded by ThreeFoldâ€™s [Token Distribution Event (TDE)](https://wiki.threefold.io/#/tdeoverview)</a> for the impact it brings to our planet, humanity and the ThreeFold Grid.
The ThreeFold Token (TFT) represents a unit of capacity on the new Internet and is created only when new capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid. Each project on the TDE benefits from fund allocations in the form of branded TFTs. 
You can buy specially branded TFTs to directly support Artheon, and the growth of a new conscious internet.
